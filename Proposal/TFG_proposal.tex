In this paper we propose REACT, a distributed framework for reactive network resilience, which allows networks to reconfigure themselves in the event of a security incidents so that the risk of further damage is mitigated. Our framework takes advantage of a risk model based on multilayer networks, as well as a graph-coloring problem conversion, to identify new, more resilient configurations for networks in the event of an attack. We propose two different solution approaches, and evaluate them from two different perspectives, with a number of centralized optimization techniques. Experiments show that our approaches outperform the reference approaches in terms of risk mitigation and performance."

    \section{Introduction}
        Time to write! Remember you can cite bibliography entries with \textbackslash cite\{bib:REACT\}, for instance. This produces something like \cite{bib:REACT}. Remember to change \texttt{bib:REACT} for whatever you include in your entries!\\

        We prefer to separate paragraphs in between them and thus use \textbackslash \textbackslash\ when finishing one. You can decide not to do the same: it's a matter of style after all...

    \section{Objectives and field of application}
        Another section...

    \section{Project description}
        This is a long one :P

    \section{Development plan}
        We decided to use an enumeration for this one. You can choose something else though :P

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Hey there!}: Faa.
            \item \textbf{Hey there!}: Fii.
        \end{enumerate}

    \section{Working resources}
        Last section, yay!

            % document. You can decide to use it or not, up to you!
