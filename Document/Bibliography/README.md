# Bibliography Entries
These files contain the bibliography entries that are later added to the end of the document. One can usually find these entries by searching for terms such as `document-name + bibtex` or `document-name + bib entry`.

The name provided on the first line of an entry is what needs to be passed to the `\cite{}` command within the document. We personally chose to leverage the `bib:name` format to aide us during the document's correction.
